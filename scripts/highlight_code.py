# This script runs through all the html files in notebooks/, and 
#  converts `###highlight=[1,2,10,11,12]` directives to style directives
#  for highlighting lines of code in code cells.

# To highlight lines of code in a cell, add a comment on the first
#  line of the cell, starting with three pound symbols, the word
#  'highlight', and an equals sign with no space. Then write a Python
#  list, with each line to be highlighted listed. The script only reads
#  comma-separated values, not grouped values. 

# yes: '###highlight=[1,2,7,8,9]'
# no:  '###highlight=[1,2,7-9]'

# You can turn line numbering on in the notebook, and just use the line
#  numbers that are displayed. The script adjusts for the first line 
#  being taken up by the ###highlight= comment. The script also removes
#  the ###highlight= comment from the html file, but does not remove
#  the highlighting directive from the notebook itself.

# The script adds the style directive
# <div class="highlighted_code_line">...current code html...</div>
# to the selected code lines.

# The script assumes all html files are not nested, in a directory called
#  'notebooks'.

# You will need to specificy path_to_notebooks.
