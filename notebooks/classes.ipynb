      "So far you have learned about Python's core data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. In this section you will learn about the last major data structure, classes. Classes are quite unlike the other data types, in that they are much more flexible. Classes allow you to define the information and behavior that characterize anything you want to model in your program. Classes are a rich topic, so you will learn just enough here to dive into the projects you'd like to get started on.\n",

      "The first line shows how a class is created in Python. The keyword **class** tells Python that you are about to define a class. The rules for naming a class are the same rules you learned about [naming variables](var_string_num.html#naming_rules), but there is a strong convention among Python programmers that classes should be named using CamelCase. If you are unfamiliar with CamelCase, it is a convention where each letter that starts a word is capitalized, with no underscores in the name. The name of the class is followed by a set of parentheses. These parentheses will be empty for now, but later they may contain a class upon which the new class is based.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is good practice to write a comment at the beginning of your class, describing the class. There is a [more formal syntax](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for documenting your classes, but you can wait a little bit to get that formal. For now, just write a comment at the beginning of your class summarizing what you intend the class to do. Writing more formal documentation for your classes will be easy later if you start by writing simple comments now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Function names that start and end with two underscores are special built-in functions that Python uses in certain ways. The \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ method is one of these special functions. It is called automatically when you create an object from your class. The \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ function lets you make sure that all relevant attributes are set to their proper values when an object is created from the class, before the object is used. In this case, The \\_\\_init\\_\\_() function initializes the x and y values of the Rocket to 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **self** keyword often takes people a little while to understand. The word \"self\" refers to the current object that you are working with. When you are writing a class, it lets you refer to certain attributes from any other part of the class. Basically, all methods in a class need the *self* object as their first argument, so they can access any attribute that is part of the class.\n",

It's good to emphasize that these are changes in the x and y position, not new values for the actual position of the rocket. By carefully choosing the right default values, we can define a meaningful default behavior. If someone calls the method move_rocket() with no parameters, the rocket will simply move up one unit in the y-direciton. Note that this method can be given negative values to move the rocket left or right:"
