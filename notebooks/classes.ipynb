    "So far you have learned about Python's core data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. In this section you will learn about the last major data structure, classes. Classes are quite unlike the other data types, in that they are much more flexible. Classes allow you to define the information and behavior that characterize anything you want to model in your program. Classes are a rich topic, so you will learn just enough here to dive into the projects you'd like to get started on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of new language that comes into play when you start learning about classes. If you are familiar with object-oriented programming from your work in another language, this will be a quick read about how Python approaches OOP. If you are new to programming in general, there will be a lot of new ideas here. Just start reading, try out the examples on your own machine, and trust that it will start to make sense as you work your way through the examples and exercises."

The name of the class is followed by a set of parentheses. These parentheses will be empty for now, but later they may contain a class upon which the new class is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to write a comment at the beginning of your class, describing the class. There is a [more formal syntax](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for documenting your classes, but you can wait a little bit to get that formal. For now, just write a comment at the beginning of your class summarizing what you intend the class to do. Writing more formal documentation for your classes will be easy later if you start by writing simple comments now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function names that start and end with two underscores are special built-in functions that Python uses in certain ways. The \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ method is one of these special functions. It is called automatically when you create an object from your class. The \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ method lets you make sure that all relevant attributes are set to their proper values when an object is created from the class, before the object is used. In this case, The \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method initializes the x and y values of the Rocket to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **self** keyword often takes people a little while to understand. The word \"self\" refers to the current object that you are working with. When you are writing a class, it lets you refer to certain attributes from any other part of the class. Basically, all methods in a class need the *self* object as their first argument, so they can access any attribute that is part of the class.\n",

    "#### Your Own Rocket 2\n",
    "- There are enough new concepts here that you might want to try re-creating the [Rocket class](#adding_method) as it has been developed so far, looking at the examples as little as possible. Once you have your own version, regardless of how much you needed to look at the example, you can modify the class and explore the possibilities of what you have already learned.\n",
    "    - Re-create the Rocket class as it has been developed so far:\n",
    "        - Define the Rocket() class.\n",
    "        - Define the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method. Let your \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method accept x and y values for the initial position of the rocket. Make sure the default behavior is to position the rocket at (0,0).\n",
    "        - Define the move_rocket() method. The method should accept an amount to move left or right, and an amount to move up or down.\n",
    "        - Create a Rocket object. Move the rocket around, printing its position after each move.\n",
    "        - Create a small fleet of rockets. Move several of them around, and print their final positions to prove that each rocket can move independently of the other rockets.\n",
    "        - Define the get_distance() method. The method should accept a Rocket object, and calculate the distance between the current rocket and the rocket that is passed into the method.\n",
    "        - Use the get_distance() method to print the distances between several of the rockets in your fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rocket Attributes\n",
    "- Start with a copy of the Rocket class, either one you made from a previous exercise or the latest version from the [last section](#adding_method).\n",
    "- Add several of your own attributes to the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() function. The values of your attributes can be set automatically by the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function, or they can be set by parameters passed into \\_\\_init\\_\\_().\n",
    "- Create a rocket and print the values for the attributes you have created, to show they have been set correctly.\n",
    "- Create a small fleet of rockets, and set different values for one of the attributes you have created. Print the values of these attributes for each rocket in your fleet, to show that they have been set properly for each rocket.\n",
    "- If you are not sure what kind of attributes to add, you could consider storing the height of the rocket, the crew size, the name of the rocket, the speed of the rocket, or many other possible characteristics of a rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rocket Methods\n",
    "- Start with a copy of the Rocket class, either one you made from a previous exercise or the latest version from the [last section](#adding_method).\n",
    "- Add a new method to the class. This is probably a little more challenging than adding attributes, but give it a try.\n",
    "    - Think of what rockets do, and make a very simple version of that behavior using print statements. For example, rockets lift off when they are launched. You could make a method called *launch()*, and all it would do is print a statement such as \"The rocket has lifted off!\" If your rocket has a name, this sentence could be more descriptive.\n",
    "    - You could make a very simple *land_rocket()* method that simply sets the x and y values of the rocket back to 0. Print the position before and after calling the *land_rocket()* method to make sure your method is doing what it's supposed to.\n",
    "    - If you enjoy working with math, you could implement a *safety_check()* method. This method would take in another rocket object, and call the get_distance() method on that rocket. Then it would check if that rocket is too close, and print a warning message if the rocket is too close. If there is zero distance between the two rockets, your method could print a message such as, \"The rockets have crashed!\" (Be careful; getting a zero distance could mean that you accidentally found the distance between a rocket and itself, rather than a second rocket.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Person Class\n",
    "- Modeling a person is a classic exercise for people who are trying to learn how to write classes. We are all familiar with characteristics and behaviors of people, so it is a good exercise to try.\n",
    "    - Define a Person() class.\n",
    "    - In the \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ function, define several attributes of a person. Good attributes to consider are name, age, place of birth, and anything else you like to know about the people in your life.\n",
    "    - Write one method. This could be as simple as *introduce_yourself()*. This method would print out a statement such as, \"Hello, my name is Eric.\"\n",
    "    - You could also make a method such as *age_person()*. A simple version of this method would just add 1 to the person's age.\n",
    "        - A more complicated version of this method would involve storing the person's birthdate rather than their age, and then calculating the age whenever the age is requested. But dealing with dates and times is not particularly easy if you've never done it in any other programming language before.\n",
    "    - Create a person, set the attribute values appropriately, and print out information about the person.\n",
    "    - Call your method on the person you created. Make sure your method executed properly; if the method does not print anything out directly, print something before and after calling the method to make sure it did what it was supposed to.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Car Class\n",
    "- Modeling a car is another classic exercise.\n",
    "    - Define a Car() class.\n",
    "    - In the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() function, define several attributes of a car. Some good attributes to consider are make (Subaru, Audi, Volvo...), model (Outback, allroad, C30), year, num_doors, owner, or any other aspect of a car you care to include in your class.\n",
    "    - Write one method. This could be something such as *describe_car()*. This method could print a series of statements that describe the car, using the information that is stored in the attributes. You could also write a method that adjusts the mileage of the car or tracks its position.\n",
    "    - Create a car object, and use your method.\n",
    "    - Create several car objects with different values for the attributes. Use your method on several of your cars."

    "Inheritance\n",
    "===\n",
    "One of the most important goals of the object-oriented approach to programming is the creation of stable, reliable, reusable code. If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code. In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can **inherit** from another class. This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate. The original class is called the **parent** class, and the new class is a **child** of the parent class. The parent class is also called a **superclass**, and the child class is also called a **subclass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child class inherits all attributes and behavior from the parent class, but any attributes that are defined in the child class are not available to the parent class. This may be obvious to many people, but it is worth stating. This also means a child class can override behavior of the parent class. If a child class defines a method that also appears in the parent class, objects of the child class will use the new method rather than the parent class method.\n",
