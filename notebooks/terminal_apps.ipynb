    "What are terminal apps?\n",
    "===\n",
    "A terminal application is simply an application that runs inside the terminal. By now, you have seen that most of the output from your programs is printed to the terminal. By learning a few more techniques such as clearing the terminal screen and \"pickling\" data, you can create full-fledged standalone applications that run in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminal app starts just like any other program, but it finishes when the user selects an action that causes the program to quit. In terminal applications, this often means something like entering 'q' or 'quit'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on a linux system, you can run some terminal apps right now. Many of these are not written in Python, but that doesn't matter. They are applications that run in the terminal, and you can write your own apps in Python. If you are on Linux, try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open a terminal and enter `top`.\n",
    "    - You will see a bunch of processes that are running on your system, sorted by which ones are using the most resources.\n",
    "    - You can press 'q' to quit this application.\n",
    "- Open a terminal and enter `nano test_file.txt`. \n",
    "    - This is a text editor that runs in the terminal. It is useful for quick edits.\n",
    "    - If you are editing files on a remote server, you need a terminal-based editor. Nano is one of the simplest.\n",
    "    - Press Ctrl-x to exit. If you have typed anything, you will be given the option to save your file.\n",
    "- Open a terminal and enter `vi`.\n",
    "    - This is another text editor. It is much less intuitive than nano at first, but once you learn how to use it you can edit files extremely quickly.\n",
    "    - Enter `:q` to exit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are quite a few other terminal apps. Let's figure out how to write some of our own."

    "Why write terminal apps?\n",
    "---\n",
    "Unless you see people working in technical fields on a regular basis, it's quite possible you have not seen many people using terminal applications. Even so, there are a number of reasons to consider writing a few terminal apps of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **They can be much more fun and satisfying to write than simpler programs.**\n",
    "    - Applications, by their nature, solve interesting problems. When you write an application, you are creating an environment in which people work and play. That's pretty satisfying.\n",
    "- **Terminal apps let you play with complex code, without layers of abstraction between you and the user.**\n",
    "    - When you write more complex graphical applications, there are layers of abstraction between you and the user. To get input in a terminal, you issue the command `input(\"Please tell me some information: \")`. When you want some information in a graphical program, you have to build text boxes and buttons for submitting information. That has gotten pretty simple these days, but it is still more complicated than what you will do when writing terminal applications. Terminal applications let you focus on getting the logic right, rather than building a graphical interface.\n",
    "- **You will learn about user interaction issues.**\n",
    "    - Terminal apps do have users, even if that is just you, and maybe your friends or family. If you see people using your applications at an early stage, you will write better code. There is nothing like watching people use your programs to make you code more defensively. You know to enter a string in some places, but what keeps your users from entering numbers? Influencing your users to give you the right information the first time, and being prepared to deal with the wrong kind of data are good skills as a programmer. Having real users at an early stage in your programming career is a good thing."
